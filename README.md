# Mastermind
Basic implementation of the Mastermind board game - from The Odin Project
curriculum.

In this project, I plan to continue practicing the skills that I've learned
from The Odin Project curriculum so far. I will be using a hash for the first
time in a project outside of the exercises from the curriculum and I will
continue to use arrays to store data and any of the related methods.

The part of this project that will prove to be a challenge is coming up with
an algorithm for the computer to guess the player's code since that requires
researching some strategies for how to best go about making guesses and solving
the code.
